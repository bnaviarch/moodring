moodring by abhinav gupta + stephen zimmerer
-
moodring is a joint choreography of two people making things.
considering that our displays may only really influence our physical spaces with lighting and colours, 
the site uses our keyboards/keys as a way to indicate our moods to our partners by changing the colours of our displays.
both partners indicate their moods at the same time by changing one side of our displays, 
thereby giving a gradient of moods that influence partners’ physical spaces in a shared way 
-- a solid color may, therefore, indicate a shared mood.
moreover, the log page, linked from the home page, is a page where partners may enter these gradients into a record,
forming the ‘shared mood-space’ of the moment 
-- the log, in and of itself, becomes a new ‘shared mood-space’ with the element of time.
